Use a dummy variable by instantiating a new ClassNode variable = ListNode(). Set tail to dummy. Loop over l1 and l2 while they both exist. If the current l1 val is less than l2, set tail.next to l1 and increment l1. Vice versa for l2. At the bottom of the loop set tail = tail.next. There may be a leftover list at the end of the loop if they are different lengths. Essentially append the non null list to the tail.next after the loop. Return dummy.next as that is the true tail.
